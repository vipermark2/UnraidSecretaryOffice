# Unraid Secretary Office - what the plugin's cron file calls (written by the
# office: agent/lib/house.php, officeJobSetSchedule()).
#
#   job.sh backup      Mr. Backupsy's nightly run (the engine in backup/)
#   job.sh snapshots   Ms. Snapshotini's schedules: the snapshots that are due
#   job.sh embycache   Jack Emby: EmbyCache (what's watched next onto the pool)
#   job.sh gather      Jack Emby: the media gather (folders together on one disk)
#   job.sh moverelli   Ms. Moverelli: a real Smart Mover run (the bundled smartmover/)
#   job.sh watch       is the agent at work? (agent-watch.cron, written by scripts/agent.sh)
#
# Only while the array is started (agent.sh's array_started): the office's data
# lies in appdata, and nothing may land in /mnt while it is a bare RAM folder.
# The watch looks itself (a stopped array resets its count).
#
# Once per job and minute: Unraid's crond reads root's own crontab as well as
# /etc/cron.d/root, so a line that is in both (or twice in one) starts a job
# twice at the same time. The second start ends here quietly, with one line in
# the syslog (the night watchman and Ms. Protocolli see it).
